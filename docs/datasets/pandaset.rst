PandaSet
--------

The PandaSet dataset is a multi-modal dataset that includes data from cameras and Lidars, along with detailed 3D bounding box annotations.
It includes 103 logs of 8 second duration, resulting in about 0.2 hours of data.
PandaSet stands out, due to its no-cost commercial license.

Download
~~~~~~~~

Since a few years, the official PandaSet dataset download no longer available (see `Issue #151 <https://github.com/scaleapi/pandaset-devkit/issues/151>`_).
However, unofficial copies of the dataset can be found on `Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/datasets/georghess/pandaset>`_ or `Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usharengaraju/pandaset-dataset/dataset>`_.

The 123D conversion expects the following directory structure:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local-mode conversion has no extra dependencies. The HuggingFace-based downloader and
streaming flow require the ``pandaset`` extras group (which installs ``huggingface_hub``):

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install py123d[pandaset]


Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Local mode** — data already extracted to ``$PANDASET_DATA_ROOT`` (see the `Download`_
section above):

.. code-block:: bash

  py123d-conversion datasets=["pandaset"]

.. note::
  The conversion of PandaSet by default does not store sensor data in the logs, but only
  relative file paths. To change this behavior, you need to adapt the ``pandaset.yaml``
  converter configuration.

**Streaming mode** — extract each log from a shared ``pandaset.zip`` (community
HuggingFace mirror) to a per-log temp directory at parse time and delete it afterwards.
The ~44.5 GB zip is downloaded on first access into
``<system_temp>/py123d-pandaset-cache/`` (shared across workers) and reused for
the remaining logs of the run:

.. code-block:: bash

  # First run: downloads pandaset.zip (~44.5 GB) into <system_temp>, then streams 3 logs.
  py123d-conversion dataset=pandaset-stream \
      dataset.parser.downloader.num_logs=3

  # Stream specific logs:
  py123d-conversion dataset=pandaset-stream \
      'dataset.parser.downloader.log_names=[001, 002, 005]'

  # Park the 44.5 GB zip somewhere with room (system temp is often too small):
  py123d-conversion dataset=pandaset-stream \
      dataset.parser.downloader.num_logs=3 \
      dataset.parser.downloader.zip_cache_dir=/mnt/scratch/pandaset_zip_cache

.. warning::
  Even small values of ``num_logs`` trigger the full ~44.5 GB download on first use —
  the HuggingFace mirror is a single monolithic zip, not per-log archives. The zip
  is written to a shared temp location (not ``$HF_HOME``), so subsequent runs on the
  same machine reuse it until the system temp dir is cleared.

.. note::
  Streaming mode forces ``camera_store_option: "jpeg_binary"`` and
  ``lidar_store_option: "binary"`` — the per-log temp directory is deleted immediately
  after conversion, so any ``"path"`` references would point at vanished sources.

To pre-stage data outside the conversion pipeline (download the zip and extract logs
into a persistent ``$PANDASET_DATA_ROOT`` for later local-mode runs), use the
standalone downloader. The zip itself is fetched into a session-scoped temp directory
and removed once extraction completes — only the unpacked log folders survive:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Download the zip to a temp dir, extract all 103 logs to $PANDASET_DATA_ROOT,
  # and delete the zip.
  py123d-download dataset=pandaset

  # Or a handful of logs:
  py123d-download dataset=pandaset \
      'downloader.log_names=[001, 002, 005]'


Dataset Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Ego Vehicle:** The ego vehicle parameters are estimates from the vehicle model. The exact location of the IMU/GPS sensor and the bounding box dimensions of the ego vehicle may not be accurate.
* **Bounding Boxes:** PandaSet provides bounding boxes that fall in the overlap of the Lidar region twice (for each point cloud). The current implementation only uses the bounding boxes of the top Lidar sensor.
* **Lidar:** PandaSet does not motion compensate the Lidar sweeps (in contrast to other datasets). Artifacts remain visible.
